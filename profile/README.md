## Zeur: A Zero-Interest Loan Protocol for the Real Economy

Zeur is a decentralized lending platform where users can borrow EUR-backed stablecoins (e.g., EURC) without paying interest by using crypto assets like ETH, LINK, or LSTs as collateral. Instead of charging interest, the protocol earns yield from staking/lending strategies and passes it to EURC lenders.

## The Problem We Solve

Crypto users in Europe often need liquidity for real-world purchases but donâ€™t want to sell assets due to taxes and future price potential. Current options include:

* High-interest DeFi loans
* Slow, paperwork-heavy TradFi loans
* Other zero-interest protocols with illiquid, non-fiat stablecoins

These fail to offer simple, low-cost, real-world access to funds.

## Our Solution

Zeur offers:

* **Zero-interest, flexible repayment** for borrowers
* **High, stable yields** on EURC for lenders
* A smooth **bridge between crypto and real-world spending** using regulated, fiat-backed EURC

## Overview

Zeur blends DeFi lending with staking to let users borrow EUR stablecoins while earning yield on their crypto collateral.

## Key Features

* **Collateralized Lending:** Secure loans using ETH/LINK with customizable LTV ratios
* **Auto Staking:** Collateral is staked in protocols like Lido and Morpho to earn yield
* **EUR Loans:** Use EURC/EURI, improving access to euros over USD
* **Liquidation Protection:** Automated systems ensure safety and stability with real-time monitoring
